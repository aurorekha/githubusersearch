# Github Search
This is a little app which lets you search for github users with their user name.
- It gives you a little info on how many repositories the user has
- A link to the readme which takes you to the readme api.
- How many followers the user has
- User location

#How to get the app started
- cd into the file
- npm install
- npm start

That's all!

I have added very basic styles using bootstrap.
Made this little app using react

The github api is very limited so it kept throwing a 403(however it should be 429 or 420)
this made the whole development very slowly.

p.s. - I have had another look before wanting to send the exercise over and it says to use
a different api to reach with repo names however i ended up doing the whole thing
based on searching with username.
